Hello, this is a demo file.
This file is for testing the grep clone.
It has multiple lines.
Some lines have the word 'test' and some have 'Test'.
We need to test for case sensitivity.

This line is unique.
This line has a number: 12345
And this line has a symbol: #example
Here is a line with the word test repeated: test test test

This line has a word in the middle.
What about words at the end of the line? test
Or words at the beginning: test is the word.

Lines for simple pattern matching:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox.
Just another line.
